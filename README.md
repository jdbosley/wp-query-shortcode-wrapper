WordPress WP_Query Shortcode Wrapper
=====

I got tired of constantly writing custom shortcodes to implement WP_Query queries in WordPress page content.

The WP_Query Shortcode Wrapper allows you to to pass WP_Query arguements into your shortcode and specify a "template" (basically just a path to a loop file) to use as the output.

Next up on the to do list is to implement better support for tax_query and meta_query, including having multiple tax_queries and multiple meta_queries.
